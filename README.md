# isds - Analysis of individual size distributions (of mammals)

### Status as of 12/12/2019

I consider all branches stale except for `overlap`. 

Efforts prior to overlap were getting increasingly creative and artisinal about finding ways to count the number of modes and/or gaps in an ISD. At this point I'm not really convinced anything is better than doing it by eye, with double-blinding and multiple people doing the assessments. It's a pretty flawed process. :P
